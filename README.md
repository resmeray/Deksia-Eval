Eval Deksia Internship

All files are located in one folder for convenience (code files and image files).
I worked mainly from the provided XD File.

deskia-webpage.html

### CSS File: 
deksia-webpage.css

### JS File: 
deksia.wepbage.js

### Notes:
--> The Javascript file stores a class to create FAQ Question objects.

--> The website was made for a medium-size screen (~1200px).
